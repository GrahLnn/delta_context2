# Task Plan: Support local file paths in process ytb_url

## Goal
Update main class process to accept local file paths for ytb_url, detect local paths, skip download, and move file to the same destination used for downloads while keeping downstream processing unchanged.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [x] Phase 3: Execute/build
- [x] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions
1. Where is main class process implemented and how does it handle ytb_url today?
2. What is the download destination path and how is the filename determined?

## Decisions Made
- None yet.

## Errors Encountered
- None yet.

## Status
**Currently in Phase 4** - Complete.
